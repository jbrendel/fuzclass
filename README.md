# FuzClass #

A new and improved way of programming has finally arrived!

Natural language is fuzzy. Oftentimes, we mean 'foobar', but write something
like 'fubar'. A simple, harmless typo! Why should the computer complain and be
so annoyingly picky? Instead, could it not help us by recognizing what we
really meant and just quitely correct such innocent typos?

With FuzClass we finally have relief! At last, the full potential of the
computer is unleashed. Instead of bothering us with aannoying attribute-errors
all the time, we can finally allow it to actually be of help while we are
developing.

Say goodbye to typo-induced attribute errors, once and for all!

Requirements: The 'fuzzy' package. Install with: pip install fuzzy
